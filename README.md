Overview

This project demonstrates a simple end-to-end web scraping pipeline:

A Python scraper that crawls quotes from a public website and stores structured data.

A lightweight React UI that visualizes and explores the scraped results.

Itâ€™s intentionally built to be easy to run, understand, and extend.
